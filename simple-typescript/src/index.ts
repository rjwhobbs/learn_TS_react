//You don't have to set the types explicitly all the time. TypeScript infers types where it's possible:
let XX = 1; // is equivalent to let XX: number = 1;
     
function log<T>(message: T) {}
log(1); // is equivalent to log<number>(1)

// TypeScript includes the type called unknown. We can use this type to describe a value which we don't know. For example, a value returned from a network call:

const getSomeDataFromSomeAPICall = () => {}; // silence
let data: unknown = getSomeDataFromSomeAPICall();
     
if (typeof data === 'string') {
  // data is a string.
} else if (Array.isArray(data)) {
  // data is an array.
} else if (typeof data === 'object') {
  // data is an object.
}

// Now you'd ask: "Why don't use any in this case?". The differences are:
// 1. TS forces you to determine the type of the unknown value before you can work with it:

let anyValue: any = 1;
let unknownValue: unknown = 1;
 
//anyValue.helloWorld(); // No error, but runtime error
// unknownValue.helloWorld(); // you'll get a TS error.

// 2. You cannot assign unknown to anything but itself or any, while you can assign any to anything:
/*
let anyValue: any = 1;
let unknownValue: unknown = 1;
 
let str: string;
 
str = anyValue; // No error.
str = unknownValue; // you'll get a TS error.
*/

//These constraints make sure that you verify the unknown value before working with it, which is important to reduce the possibility of a runtime error.

//Type assertion (you can't simply assert that a value can have any type you want)

// You can't assert a value to be of type which doesn't overlap with the actual type of the value:

/*
    let b = '1' as number; // Error, you can't say that a string is a number.
     
    interface User {
      name: string;
      email: string;
    }
     
    function saveUser(user: User) {}
     
    saveUser(<User>{ helloWorld: '' }); // Error, this object doesn't have the required properties of the User interface.

    A workaround for asserting a value to be of type which doesn't overlap with the value's actual type 
    is to assert that the value is unknown first: saveUser(<User>(<unknown>{ helloWorld: '' })). 
    But, do your best to avoid this workaround, because it simply makes your code unsafe.

// Overall, try to avoid assertions as much as possible, use them only when they are necessary, like the user-defined type guards:

interface Cat {
  meow(): void;
}
 
interface Dog {
  bark(): void;
}
 
function isCat(pet: Cat | Dog): pet is Cat {
  return (<Cat>pet).meow !== undefined;
}
 
function greet(pet: Cat | Dog) {
  if (isCat(pet)) {
    pet.meow();
  } else {
    pet.bark();
  }
}
